        <p>
          Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in
          order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs,
          and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The assessment is
          sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
          read and understand the material, and form questions they may have
          prior to the actual meeting. Parent/teacher conferences are held twice
          a year (Fall and Spring).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fall conference is informal. Teachers meet with parents, relate to
          them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any
          questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spring conference is more formal. Teachers fill out an assessment
          form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal
          observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
          child.
